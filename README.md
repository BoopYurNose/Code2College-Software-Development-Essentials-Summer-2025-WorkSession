# Code2College-Software-Development-Essentials-Summer-2025-WorkSession
These are work Sessons that I did during summer 2025. I'll still do some every now and then because I haven't finished them all. A lot of the earlier ones were lost to time due to me accidentally deleting a file on my laptop that contained them. (⩾﹏⩽) 
Also Some might be duplicate of eachother because I have a laptop and a computer and when I had only access to my laptop sometimes I'd forget that I had already completed a specific work session task so I'd do it again :D
